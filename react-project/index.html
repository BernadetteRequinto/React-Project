    <h3>What is React?</h3>
    <p>
      React, often referred to as React.js or ReactJS, is a JavaScript library
      known for its flexibility and efficiency in creating interactive user
      interfaces (UIs) for both web and native applications. With its
      component-based architecture, developers can create UI elements like
      buttons or search bars, which can then be reused throughout an
      application. This not only streamlines the development process but also
      enhances maintainability.
